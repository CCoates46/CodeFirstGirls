                    <h2>It was all a Surprise!</h2>

                        <p>About six months ago, I began my journey into learning Javascript, and I began to post on my LinkedIn account about my journey.</p>
                    
                        <p>Very slowly my posts have begun to gain followers and one of my followers was the director of Digital Engineering here at Dunelm.<br>
                       He was enjoying my posts and asked if I would write a post on Dunelm's very own Dunelm-Technology blog.</p>

                        <p>Today my post went live on the blog and it has received such a positive response.</p>

                        <p>Here is a link to my post <a href="https://engineering.dunelm.com/fun-fact-1-i-started-my-career-licking-envelopes-42477bc9db19"target="blank">Fun Fact 1!</a></p>
